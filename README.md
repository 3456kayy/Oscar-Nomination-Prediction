<h1>Forecasting Movie Nominations</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

The objective of this task is to predict whether a movie will be nominated for an Oscar using various machine learning models and a dataset of movie features. The dataset includes attributes such as marketing expenses, ratings from different sources, box office collections, and more. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, feature selection, log transformation to address skewness, and scaling numerical values. Several models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated. The models' performances were measured using cross-validation scores and ROC AUC metrics. The Logistic Regression and XGBoost models demonstrated higher AUC scores compared to the others, indicating their relatively better performance in predicting potential Oscar nominees. Visualizations, such as heatmaps and box plots, were included to examine feature relationships and data distribution. Confusion matrices were used to assess model performance, providing insights into prediction accuracy. The project offers insights into the relationships between different movie attributes and their likelihood of receiving an Oscar nomination.
